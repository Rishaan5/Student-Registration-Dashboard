localStorage (data persistence)
No build tools, no node_modules, no frameworks.

Default Credentials

Future Improvements (Ideas)
Add search/filter in admin table
Input for profile picture upload (base64 in localStorage)
Better password handling for admin
Pagination for large student lists
Print/student ID card generation
Import students from CSV
Move admin credentials to a more secure pattern (even for demo)
